The cube, 41063625 (3453), can be permuted to produce two other cubes: 56623104 (3843) and 66430125 (4053).
In fact, 41063625 is the smallest cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube.

Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits are cube.


Strategy


1. Iterate from starting cube of 3454.
2. Create permutations.
3. Evaluate ALL permutations for cubes.
4. If all permutations yields four cubes, stop iterating and present solution.


Helpful known constraints
    1. A solution's number of digits must contain at least the number of cubes sought.
    2. Searching for four additional cube permutations. Remember, the cube itself counts.
    3. Found 4 cubics @ 1006012008.
    4. pick up from 522 + 1002 => 1524
